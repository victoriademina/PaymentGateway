[![.NET](https://github.com/victoriademina/PaymentGateway/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/victoriademina/PaymentGateway/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

## Prerequisites

This project relies on the following dependencies:

* [.NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
* [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)
* [Entity Framework Core 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/in-memory/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli)
* [NUnit](https://nunit.org/), [Moq](https://github.com/moq)
* [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Getting-Started), [Serilog.Sinks.Console](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Getting-Started)

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to run the project:
1. Clone Payment gateway to your local machine. You can download the project files, or clone by SSH: `git clone git@github.com:victoriademina/PaymentGateway.git`
2. To run the project, simply execute `dotnet run` from `src/PaymentGateway.Api` folder. By defailt, Swagger page will be opened on `http://localhost:5252/swagger/index.html`, but you can specify a localhost of your choice in `launchSettings.json`.
3. To run tests, execure `dotnet test` from the root directory.

## Project Architecture

The project was developed following the [Clean Architecture principles](https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started/). 
According to the Clean Architecture, **Domain** and **Application** layers are at the centre of the design, the **Core** of the system.
All dependencies flow inwards and Core has no dependency on any other layer. **Infrastructure** and **Api** depend on Core, but not on one another.

The following architecture provides multiple benefits:

1. 
2. Data storage concerns are being separated from the core logic, it enables an easy migration to any database of your choice in the future.
Independent of frameworks it does not require the existence of some tool or framework
Testable easy to test â€“ Core has no dependencies on anything external, so writing automated tests is much easier
Independent of UI logic is kept out of the UI so it is easy to change to another technology â€“ right now you might be using Angular, soon Vue, eventually Blazor!
Independent of the database data-access concerns are cleanly separated so moving from SQL Server to CosmosDB or otherwise is trivial
Independent of anything external in fact, Core is completely isolated from the outside world â€“ the difference between a system that will last 3 years, and one that will last 20 years

### PaymentGateway.Domain
This contains all entities and enums specific to the domain layer.

### BankSimulator
This service simulates an Aquiring Bank.

### PaymentGateway.Api

### PaymentGateway.Application

### PaymentGateway.Infrastructure


## Usage

The Payment Gateway API is a RESTful API that exposes the following endpoints:

* `POST /merchants/create`: This endpoint is used to create a merchant, who then can be used to make transactions via Payment Gateway.
* `POST /transactions/create`: This endpoint is used to create a transaction. 
* `GET /transactions/get/{merchantId}/{transactionId}`: This endpoint is used to retrieve the transaction details by ID of merchant who made the transaction and payment ID.

To use the Payment Gateway API, you can send HTTP requests to these endpoints using a tool such as Postman.

## Assumptions

## Areas for improvements

## Recommended Choice of Cloud Technologies

**Amazon Web Services**
- EC2 - run back-end
- DynamoDB - serverless NoSQL database. 
- AWS SQS - a message queuing service queue for enabling event-driven communicaton between BankAdapter and BankSimulator.
- AWS CodePipelne/CircleCI/Jenkins - set up CI/CD

## Bonus Features

### Data Validation
### Logging using Serilog
### Github Workflow CI
This project is equipped with a continuous integration (CI) workflow that utilizes GitHub Actions to automate the building and testing of the .NET codebase with every commit. This workflow has been carefully crafted to ensure that the project's functionality and stability are maintained at all times.
