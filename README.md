## Project Structure

The Payment Gateway project is structured as follows:

### PaymentGateway.Domain
This contains all entities and enums specific to the domain layer.

### BankSimulator
This service simulates an Aquiring Bank.

### PaymentGateway.Api

### PaymentGateway.Application

### PaymentGateway.Infrastructure


## Usage

The Payment Gateway API is a RESTful API that exposes the following endpoints:

* `POST /merchants/create`: This endpoint is used to create a merchant, who then can be used to make transactions via Payment Gateway.
* `POST /transactions/create`: This endpoint is used to create a transaction. 
* `GET /transactions/get/{merchantId}/{transactionId}`: This endpoint is used to retrieve the transaction details by ID of merchant who made the transaction and payment ID.

To use the Payment Gateway API, you can send HTTP requests to these endpoints using a tool such as Postman.
